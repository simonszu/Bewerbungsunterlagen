# Bewerbungsunterlagen

This repo contains the usual paperwork for my various job applications. Since they are written in LaTeX, i created a small CI job with Github Actions to render them automatically as soon as a new release is tagged. 

## Note to potential employers and recruiters
I am not always actively looking for jobs. If you stumbled upon this repo and are interested, feel free to write me anyways.
